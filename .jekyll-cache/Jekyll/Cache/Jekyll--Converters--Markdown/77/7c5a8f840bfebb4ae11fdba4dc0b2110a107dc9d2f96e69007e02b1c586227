I"<p>The modeling of hydrocyclone was the first research project that I worked on. During my master thesis I modeled the separation behavior of this device through experiments, analytical models and CFD for optimization of separation in an iron-processing plant. The <strong>Response Surface Method</strong> of <strong>DOE</strong> was applied to optimized the effective parameters on the separation efficiency. The video below shows the flow pattern in a transparent lab-scale hydrocyclone that I designed and manufactured during my work.</p>
