I"c<p>In South Africa from 2010 to 2014, I developed a CFD model for prediction of flotation rate constants in a stirred flotation tank and validated against experimental data. The model incorporated local, time-varying values of the turbulent flow field into an existing kinetic flotation model. The geometry of the tank and the meshing is shown below.</p>
