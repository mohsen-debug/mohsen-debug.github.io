I"Ï<p>The modeling of hydrocyclone was the first research project that I worked on. During my master thesis I modeled the separation behavior of this device through experiments, analytical models and CFD for optimization of separation in an iron-processing plant. The <strong>Response Surface Method</strong> of <strong>DOE</strong> was applied to optimized the effective parameters on the separation efficiency. The video below shows the flow pattern in a transparent lab-scale hydrocyclone that I designed and manufactured during my work.</p>

<p>Using Gambit and Fluent, <strong>Large Eddy Simulations (LES)</strong> were performed to simulate the flow through the domain. To capture the central air-core the <strong>Volume of Fluid, (VOF)</strong> was utilized. The videos below show the flow patterns and air-core development inside the computational domain.</p>
