I"U<p>The current project that I am working on is about mass transfer intensification with application in fermentation bioreactors. I am using ANSYS Fluent and OpenFOAM for simulating a lab-scale reactor and model developments, accordingly. The project is a collaboration between <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/m2/research/fluiddynamics/Pages/default.aspx">fluid dynamics division</a> and <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/bio/research/industrial-biotechnology/Pages/default.aspx">industrial biotechnology department</a> where the measurements for are carried out.</p>
