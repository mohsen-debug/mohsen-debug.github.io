I"Í<p>From 2014 to 2017 I was a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="http://www.disat.polito.it/research/research_groups/musychen/multiscale_modelling_for_materials_science_and_process_engineering">Politecnico di Torino</a> working on MoDeNa project. MoDeNa was a multidiciplinary project that aimed at developing, demonstrating and assessing an easy-to-use multi-scale software-modeling framework under an open-source licensing scheme that delivers models with feasible computational loads for process and product design of polyurethane foams. The main scheme behind MoDeNa was to link different modeling tools developed for nano-, meso-, and macro scales with an uniform platform for simulation of foaming process.</p>
